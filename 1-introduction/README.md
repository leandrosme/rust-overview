# Following Rust Doc

## What I learned?
- As I every try new programming language, I start write a simple string called "Hello, World"
- I used cargo. Cargo is a managment library from Rust. We can use some commands such as:

To create new project with cargo:

```
  cargo new hello_cargo 
```

To run project:

```
  cargo run
```

To check. This command quickly checks your code to make sure it compiles but doesnâ€™t produce an executable:

```
  cargo check
```

To build:

```
  cargo build
```

- Exist a convention in Rust that determines that all files names should separate with spare, for example: you_file_name.rs

- We use ! always in final function that be major.
